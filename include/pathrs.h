 * Create a new (custom) procfs root handle.
 *
 * This is effectively a C wrapper around [`ProcfsHandleBuilder`], allowing you
 * to create a custom procfs root handle that can be used with other
 * `pathrs_proc_*at` methods.
 *
 * While most users should just use `PATHRS_PROC_DEFAULT_ROOTFD` (or the
 * non-`at` variants of `pathrs_proc_*`), creating an unmasked procfs root
 * handle (using `PATHRS_PROCFS_NEW_UNMASKED`) can be useful for programs that
 * need to operate on a lot of global procfs files. (Note that accessing global
 * procfs files does not *require* creating a custom procfs handle --
 * `pathrs_proc_*` will automatically create a global-friendly handle
 * internally when necessary but will close it immediately after operating on
 * it.)
 *
 * # Extensible Structs
 *
 * The [`ProcfsOpenHow`] (`struct pathrs_procfs_open_how`) argument is
 * designed to be extensible, modelled after the extensible structs scheme used
 * by Linux (for syscalls such as [clone3(2)], [openat2(2)] and other such
 * syscalls). Normally one would use symbol versioning to achieve this, but
 * unfortunately Rust's symbol versioning support is incredibly primitive (one
 * might even say "non-existent") and so this system is more robust, even if
 * the calling convention is a little strange for userspace libraries.
 *
 * In addition to a pointer argument, the caller must also provide the size of
 * the structure it is passing. By providing this information, it is possible
 * for `pathrs_procfs_open()` to provide both forwards- and
 * backwards-compatibility, with size acting as an implicit version number.
 * (Because new extension fields will always be appended, the structure size
 * will always increase.)
 *
 * If we let `usize` be the structure specified by the caller, and `lsize` be
 * the size of the structure internal to libpathrs, then there are three cases
 * to consider:
 *
 * * If `usize == lsize`, then there is no version mismatch and the structure
 *   provided by the caller can be used verbatim.
 * * If `usize < lsize`, then there are some extension fields which libpathrs
 *   supports that the caller does not. Because a zero value in any added
 *   extension field signifies a no-op, libpathrs treats all of the extension
 *   fields not provided by the caller as having zero values. This provides
 *   backwards-compatibility.
 * * If `usize > lsize`, then there are some extension fields which the caller
 *   is aware of but this version of libpathrs does not support. Because any
 *   extension field must have its zero values signify a no-op, libpathrs can
 *   safely ignore the unsupported extension fields if they are all-zero. If
 *   any unsupported extension fields are nonzero, then an `E2BIG` error is
 *   returned. This provides forwards-compatibility.
 *
 * Because the definition of `struct pathrs_procfs_open_how` may open in the
 * future
 *
 * Because the definition of `struct pathrs_procfs_open_how` may change in the
 * future (with new fields being added when headers are updated), callers
 * should zero-fill the structure to ensure that recompiling the program with
 * new headers will not result in spurious errors at run time. The simplest
 * way is to use a designated initialiser:
 *
 * ```c
 *     struct pathrs_procfs_open_how how = {
 *         .flags = PATHRS_PROCFS_NEW_UNMASKED,
 *     };
 * ```
 *
 * or explicitly using `memset(3)` or similar:
 *
 * ```c
 * struct pathrs_procfs_open_how how;
 * memset(&how, 0, sizeof(how));
 * how.flags = PATHRS_PROCFS_NEW_UNMASKED;
 * ```
 *
 * # Return Value
 *
 * On success, this function returns *either* a file descriptor *or*
 * `PATHRS_PROC_DEFAULT_ROOTFD` (this is a negative number, equal to `-EBADF`).
 * The file descriptor will have the `O_CLOEXEC` flag automatically applied.
 *
 * If an error occurs, this function will return a negative error code. To
 * retrieve information about the error (such as a string describing the error,
 * the system errno(7) value associated with the error, etc), use
 * pathrs_errorinfo().

/**
 * `pathrs_proc_open` but with a caller-provided file descriptor for `/proc`.
 *
 * Internally, `pathrs_proc_open` will attempt to use a cached copy of a very
 * restricted `/proc` handle (a detached mount object with `subset=pid` and
 * `hidepid=4`). If a user requests a global `/proc` file, a temporary handle
 * capable of accessing global files is created and destroyed after the
 * operation completes.
 *
 * For most users, this is more than sufficient. However, if a user needs to
 * operate on many global `/proc` files, the cost of creating handles can get
 * quite expensive. `pathrs_proc_openat` allows a user to manually manage the

 * descriptor to `pathrs_proc_openat` will *not* stop the automatic creation of
 * a global-friendly handle internally if necessary.
 *

/**
 * Retrieve error information about an error id returned by a pathrs operation.
 *
 * Whenever an error occurs with libpathrs, a negative number describing that
 * error (the error id) is returned. pathrs_errorinfo() is used to retrieve
 * that information:
 *
 * ```c
 * fd = pathrs_inroot_resolve(root, "/foo/bar");

 * Once pathrs_errorinfo() is called for a particular error id, that error id
 * is no longer valid and should not be used for subsequent pathrs_errorinfo()
 * calls.
 *
 * Error ids are only unique from one another until pathrs_errorinfo() is
 * called, at which point the id can be reused for subsequent errors. The
 * precise format of error ids is completely opaque and they should never be
 * compared directly or used for anything other than with pathrs_errorinfo().
 *
 * Error ids are not thread-specific and thus pathrs_errorinfo() can be called
 * on a different thread to the thread where the operation failed (this is of
 * particular note to green-thread language bindings like Go, where this is
 * important).
 *
 * # Return Value
 *
 * If there was a saved error with the provided id, a pathrs_error_t is
 * returned describing the error. Use pathrs_errorinfo_free() to free the
 * associated memory once you are done with the error.
