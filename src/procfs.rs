//!
//! The primary interface most users will interact with is [`ProcfsHandle`],
//! with most usage looking something like:
//!
//! ```rust
//! # use pathrs::flags::OpenFlags;
//! # use pathrs::procfs::{ProcfsBase, ProcfsHandle};
//! let proc = ProcfsHandle::new()?; // usually cached by libpathrs
//!
//! // Open regular procfs files (ProcfsBase indicates the base subpath of /proc
//! // the operation is acting on, effectively acting like a prefix).
//! let status = proc.open(ProcfsBase::ProcThreadSelf, "status", OpenFlags::O_RDONLY)?;
//! # let _ = status;
//!
//! // Open a magic-link safely. This even protects against bind-mounts on top
//! // of the magic-link!
//! let exe = proc.open_follow(ProcfsBase::ProcSelf, "exe", OpenFlags::O_PATH)?;
//! # let _ = exe;
//!
//! // Do a safe readlink.
//! let stdin_path = proc.readlink(ProcfsBase::ProcThreadSelf, "fd/0")?;
//! println!("stdin: {stdin_path:?}");
//! # Ok::<(), anyhow::Error>(())

/// A wrapper around a handle to `/proc` that is designed to be safe against

///
/// Unlike most regular filesystems, `/proc` serves several important purposes
/// for system administration programs:
///
///  1. As a mechanism for doing certain filesystem operations through
///     `/proc/self/fd/...` (and other similar magic-links) that cannot be done
///     by other means.
///  2. As a source of true information about processes and the general system.
///  3. As an administrative tool for managing other processes (such as setting
///     LSM labels).
///
/// libpathrs uses `/proc` internally for the first purpose and many libpathrs
/// users use `/proc` for all three. As such, it is not sufficient that
/// operations on `/proc` paths do not escape the `/proc` filesystem -- it is
/// absolutely critical that operations through `/proc` operate **on the exact
/// subpath that the caller requested**.
///
/// This might seem like an esoteric concern, but there have been several
/// security vulnerabilities where a maliciously configured `/proc` could be
/// used to trick administrative processes into doing unexpected operations (for
/// example, [CVE-2019-16884][] and [CVE-2019-19921][]). See [this
/// video][lca2020] for a longer explanation of the many other issues that
/// `/proc`-based checking is needed to protect against and [this other
/// video][lpc2022] for some other procfs challenges libpathrs has to contend
/// with.
///
/// It should be noted that there is interest in Linux upstream to block certain
/// classes of procfs overmounts entirely. Linux 6.12 notably introduced
/// [several restrictions on such mounts][linux612-procfs-overmounts], [with
/// plans to eventually block most-if-not-all overmounts inside
/// `/proc/self`][lwn-procfs-overmounts]. `ProcfsHandle` is still useful for
/// older kernels, as well as verifying that there aren't any tricky overmounts
/// anywhere else in the procfs path (such as on top of `/proc/self`).
///
/// NOTE: Users of `ProcfsHandle` should be aware that sometimes `/proc`
/// overmounting is a feature -- tools like [lxcfs] provide better compatibility
/// for system tools by overmounting global procfs files (notably
/// `/proc/meminfo` and `/proc/cpuinfo` to emulate cgroup-aware support for
/// containerisation in procfs). This means that using [`ProcfsBase::ProcRoot`]
/// may result in errors on such systems for non-privileged users, even in the
/// absence of an active attack. This is an intentional feature of libpathrs,
/// but it may be unexpected. Note that (to the best of our knowledge), there
/// are no benevolent tools which create mounts in `/proc/self` or
/// `/proc/thread-self` (mainly due to scaling and correctness issues that would
/// make production usage of such a tool impractical, even if such behaviour may
/// be desirable). As a result, we would only expect [`ProcfsBase::ProcSelf`]
/// and [`ProcfsBase::ProcThreadSelf`] operations to produce errors when you are
