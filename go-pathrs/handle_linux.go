// If you wish to open a file without having an intermediate [Handle] object,
// you can try to use [Root.Open] or [Root.OpenFile].
//
// It is critical that perform all relevant operations through this [Handle]
// (rather than fetching the file descriptor yourself with [Handle.IntoRaw]),
// because the security properties of libpathrs depend on users doing all
// relevant filesystem operations through libpathrs.
